    "When solving this variational problem, $u^0$ becomes the $L^2$ projection of the given initial value $u_0$ into the finite element space. The alternative is to construct $u^0$ by just interpolating the initial value $u_0$; that is, if $u^0=\\sum^N_{j=1}U^0_j\\phi_j$, we simply set $U_j=u_0(x_j,y_j)$, where $(x_j,y_j)$ are the coordinates of node number $j$. We refer to these two strategies as computing the initial condition by either projection or interpolation. Both operations are easy to compute in FEniCS through a single statement, using either the ```project``` or ```interpolate``` function. The most common choice is ```project```, which computes an approximation to $u_0$, but in some applications where we want to verify the code by reproducing exact solutions, one must use ```interpolate``` (and we use such a test problem here!).\n",
