    "### Finite element variational formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "FEniCS is based on the finite element method, which is a general and efficient mathematical machinery for the numerical solution of PDEs. The starting point for the finite element methods is a PDE expressed in *variational form*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic recipe for turning a PDE into a variational problem is to multiply the PDE by a function $v$, integrate the resulting equation over the domain $\\Omega$, and perform integration by parts of terms with second-order derivatives. The function $v$ which multiplies the PDE is called a *test function*. The unknown function $u$ to be approximated is referred to as a *trial function*. The terms trial and test functions are used in FEniCS programs too. The trial and test functions belong to certain so-called *function spaces* that specify the properties of the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, we first multiply the Poisson equation by the test function $v$ and integrate over $\\Omega$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "-\\int_{\\Omega}(\\Delta u)v\\ dx &= \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} f v\\ dx\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "We here let $dx$ denote the differential element for integration over the domain $\\Omega$. We will later let $ds$ denote the differential element for integration over the boundary of $\\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common rule when we derive variational formulations is that we try to keep the order of the derivatives of $u$ and $v$ as small as possible. Here, we have a second-order spatial derivative of $u$, which can be transformed to a first-derivative of $u$ and $v$ by applying the technique of [integration by parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts). Applying this to the right-hand side of the integration above yields:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "-\\int_{\\Omega}(\\Delta u)v\\ dx &= \\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v\\ dx - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega}\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}v\\ ds\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here $\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}=\\nabla u \\cdot n$ is the derivative of $u$ in the outward normal direction $n$ on the boundary.\n",
    "Another feature of variational formulations is that the test function $v$ is required to vanish on the parts of the boundary where the solution $u$ is known  [this book](./fem-book-4screen.pdf) explains in detail why this requirement is necessary). In the present problem, this means that $v=0$ on the whole boundary $\\partial \\Omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that in the last equation the second term on the left-hand side vanishes, which results in:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "-\\int_{\\Omega}(\\Delta u)v\\ dx &= \\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v\\ dx\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we require that this equation holds for all test functions $v$ in some suitable space $\\hat{V}$, the so-called *test space*, we obtain a well-defined mathematical problem that uniquely determines the solution $u$ which lies in some (possibly different) function space $V$, the so-called *trial space*. We refer to the equation above as the *weak form* or *variational form* of the original boundary-value problem.\n",

    "In short, $H^1(\\Omega)$ is the mathematically well-known Sobolev space containing functions $v$ such that $v^2$ and $|\\nabla v|^2$ have finite integrals over $\\Omega$ (essentially meaning that the functions are continuous). The solution of the underlying PDE must lie in a function space where the derivatives are also continuous, but the Sobolev space $H^1(\\Omega)$ allows functions with discontinuous derivatives. This weaker continuity requirement of $u$ in the variational statement, as a result of the integration by parts, has great practical consequences when it comes to constructing finite element function spaces. In particular, it allows the use of piecewise polynomial function spaces; i.e., function spaces constructed by stitching together polynomial functions on simple domains such as intervals, triangles, or tetrahedrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational problem is a continuous problem: it defines the solution $u$ in the infinite-dimensional function space $V$. The finite element method for the Poisson equation finds an approximate solution of the variational problem by replacing the infinite-dimensional function spaces $V$ and $\\hat{V}$ by discrete (finite-dimensional) trial and test spaces $V_h\\in V$ and $\\hat{V_h}\\in\\hat{V}$. The discrete variational problem reads: find $u_h\\in V_h\\in V$ such that\n",

    "This variational problem, together with a suitable definition of the function spaces $V_h$ and $\\hat{V_h}$, uniquely define our approximate numerical solution of Poisson’s equation. Note that the boundary conditions are encoded as part of the trial and test spaces. The mathematical framework may seem complicated at first glance, but the good news is that the finite element variational problem looks the same as the continuous variational problem, and FEniCS can automatically solve variational problems like!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following parts, we will drop the subscript $_h$ from $u_h$ and $V_h$ and instead call $u$ the solution for the discrete problem and $V$ as the discrete finite element function space in which we seek our solution.

It will be wise to construct a problem with a known analytical solution so that we can easily check that the computed solution is correct. Solutions that are lower-order polynomials are primary candidates. Standard finite element function spaces of degree $r$ will exactly reproduce polynomials of degree $r$. And piecewise linear elements ($r=1$) are able to exactly reproduce a quadratic polynomial on a uniformly partitioned mesh. This important result can be used to verify our implementation.
