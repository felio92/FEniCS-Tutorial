    "\n",
    "#### Variational formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we multiply our PDE by a test function $v\\in \\hat{V}$, integrate over the domain, and integrate the second-order derivatives by parts. The boundary integral arising from integration by parts vanishes wherever we employ Dirichlet conditions. The resulting variational formulation of our model problem becomes: find $u\\in V$ such that\n",

    "To solve a test problem, we need to choose the right-hand side $f$, the coefficient $q(u)$ and the boundary value $u_D$. Previously, we have worked with manufactured solutions that can be reproduced without approximation errors. This is more difficult in nonlinear problems, and the algebra is more tedious. However, we may utilize SymPy for symbolic computing and integrate such computations in the FEniCS solver. This allows us to easily experiment with different manufactured solutions. The forthcoming code with SymPy requires some basic familiarity with this package. In particular, we will use the SymPy functions ```diff``` for symbolic differentiation and ```ccode``` for C/C++ code generation.\n",

    "In a program like the one above, strange errors may occur due to name clashes. If you define ```sym``` and ```q``` prior to doing ```from fenics import *```, the latter statement will also import variables with the names ```sym``` and ```q```, overwriting the objects you have previously defined! This may lead to strange errors. The safest solution is to do ```import fenics``` instead of ```from fenics import *``` and then prefix all FEniCS object names by ```fenics```. The next best solution is to do ```from fenics import *``` first and then define your own variables that overwrite those imported from ```fenics```.

    "When we run the code, FEniCS reports on the progress of the Newton iterations. With $2\\cdot(8\\times 8)$ cells, we reach convergence in eight iterations with a tolerance of $10^{−9}$, and the error in the numerical solution is about $10^{−16}$. These results bring evidence for a correct implementation. Thinking in terms of finite differences on a uniform mesh, $P_1$ elements mimic standard second-order differences, which compute the derivative of a linear or quadratic function exactly. Here, $\\nabla u$ is a constant vector, but then multiplied by $(1+u^2)$, which is a second-order polynomial in $x$ and $y$, which the divergence “difference operator” should compute exactly. We can therefore, even with $P_1$ elements, expect the manufactured ```u``` to be reproduced by the numerical method. With a nonlinearity like $1+u^4$ , this will not be the case, and we would need to verify convergence rates instead.\n",

However, experts on the numerical solution of nonlinear PDEs know very well that automated procedures may fail for nonlinear problems, and that it is often necessary to have much better manual control of the solution process than what we have in the current case. We return to this problem and show how we can implement tailored solution algorithms for nonlinear equations and also how we can steer the parameters in the automated Newton method used above."
