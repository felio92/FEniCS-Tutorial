    "### The Navier - Stokes equations\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next example, we will solve the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations. This problem combines many of the challenges from our previously studied problems: time-dependence, nonlinearity, and vector-valued variables. We shall touch on a number of FEniCS topics, many of them quite advanced. But you will see that even a relatively complex algorithm such as a second-order splitting method for the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations, can be implemented with relative ease in FEniCS.\n",

    "The Navier - Stokes equations are different from the time-dependent heat equation in that we need to solve a system of equations and this system is of a special type. If we apply the same technique as for the heat equation; that is, replacing the time derivative with a simple difference quotient, we obtain a nonlinear system of equations. This in itself is not a problem for FEniCS as we saw in the section A nonlinear Poisson equation, but the system has a so-called saddle point structure and requires special techniques (special preconditioners and iterative methods) to be solved efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will apply a simpler and often very efficient approach, known as a splitting method. The idea is to consider the two equations \\eqref{eq:navier_stokes_1} and \\eqref{eq:navier_stokes_2} separately. There exist many splitting strategies for the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations. One of the oldest is the method proposed by Chorin and Temam, often referred to as Chorin’s method. We will use a modified version of Chorin’s method, the so-called incremental pressure correction scheme (IPCS) which gives improved accuracy compared to the original scheme at little extra cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPCS scheme involves three steps. First, we compute a tentative velocity $u^*$ by advancing the momentum equation \\eqref{eq:navier_stokes_1} by a midpoint finite difference scheme in time, but using the pressure $p^n$ from the previous time interval. We will also linearize the nonlinear convective term by using the known velocity $u^n$ from the previous time step: $u^n\\cdot \\nabla u^n$. The variational problem for this first step is\n",

    "where $T=\\sigma\\cdot$ n is the boundary traction. If we solve a problem with a free boundary, we can take $T=0$ on the boundary. However, if we compute the flow through a channel or a pipe and want to model flow that continues into an “imaginary channel” at the outflow, we need to treat this term with some care. The assumption we then make is that the derivative of the velocity in the direction of the channel is zero at the outflow, corresponding to a flow that is “fully developed” or doesn’t change significantly downstream of the outflow. Doing so, the remaining boundary term at the outflow becomes $p n−\\mu \\nabla u\\cdot n$, which is the term appearing in the variational problem \\eqref{eq:IPCS_tentative_velocity}. Note that this argument and the implementation depends on the exact definition of $\\nabla u$, as either the matrix with components $\\partial u_i/\\partial x_j$ or $\\partial u_j/\\partial x_i$. We here choose the latter, $\\partial u_j/\\partial x_i$, which means that we must use the FEniCS operator ```nabla_grad``` for the implementation. If we use the ```grad``` operator and the definition $\\partial u_i/∂x_j$, we must instead keep the terms $p n−\\mu(\\nabla u)^⊤\\cdot n$ !\n",

    "We now move on to the second step in our splitting scheme for the incompressible Navier - Stokes equations.

    "As a first test problem, we compute the flow between two infinite plates, so-called channel or *Poiseuille* flow. As we shall see, this problem has a known analytical solution. Let $H$ be the distance between the plates and $L$ the length of the channel. There are no body forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may scale the problem first to get rid of seemingly independent physical parameters. The physics of this problem is governed by viscous effects only, in the direction perpendicular to the flow, so a time scale should be based on diffusion accross the channel: $t_c=H^2/\\nu$. We let $U$, some characteristic inflow velocity, be the velocity scale and $H$ the spatial scale. The pressure scale is taken as the characteristic shear stress, $\\mu U/H$, since this is a primary example of shear flow. Inserting $\\bar{x}=x/H$, $\\bar{y}=y/H$, $\\bar{z}=z/H$, $\\bar{u}=u/U$, $\\bar{p}=Hp/(\\mu U)$, and $\\bar{t}=H^2/\\nu$ in the equations results in the scaled Navier - Stokes equations (dropping bars after the scaling):\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} +Re\\ u\\cdot \\nabla u &=−\\nabla p+\\nabla^2 u,\\\\\n",
    "\\nabla u &= 0.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $Re=\\rho UH/\\mu$ is the Reynolds number. Because of the time and pressure scales, which are different from convection-dominated fluid flow, the Reynolds number is associated with the convective term and not the viscosity term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact solution is derived by assuming $u=(u_x(x,y,z),0,0)$, with the x axis pointing along the channel. Since $\\nabla\\cdot u=0$, u cannot depend on $x$. The physics of channel flow is also two-dimensional so we can omit the $z$ coordinate (more precisely: $\\partial/\\partial z=0$). Inserting $u=(u_x,0,0)$ in the (scaled) governing equations gives $u′′_x(y)=\\partial p/\\partial x$. Differentiating this equation with respect to $x$ shows that $\\partial^2p/\\partial x^2=0$ so $\\partial p/\\partial x$ is a constant, here called $−\\beta$. This is the driving force of the flow and can be specified as a known parameter in the problem. Integrating $u′′x(y)=−\\beta$ over the width of the channel, $[0,1]$, and requiring $u=(0,0,0)$ at the channel walls, results in $u_x=\\frac{1}{2}\\beta y(1−y)$. The characteristic inlet velocity $U$ can be taken as the maximum inflow at $y=1/2$, implying $\\beta=8$. The length of the channel, $L/H$ in the scaled model, has no impact on the result, so for simplicity we just compute on the unit square. Mathematically, the pressure must be prescribed at a point, but since $p$ does not depend on $y$, we can set $p$ to a known value, e.g. zero, along the outlet boundary $x=1$. The result is $p(x)=8(1−x)$ and $u_x=4y(1−y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions can be set as $p=8$ at $x=0$, $p=0$ at $x=1$ and $u=(0,0,0)$ on the walls $y=0,1$. This defines the pressure drop and should result in unit maximum velocity at the inlet and outlet and a parabolic velocity profile without further specifications. Note that it is only meaningful to solve the Navier - Stokes equations in 2D or 3D geometries, although the underlying mathematical problem collapses to two 1D problems, one for $u_x(y)$ and one for $p(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scaled model is not so easy to simulate using a standard Navier - Stokes solver with dimensions. However, one can argue that the convection term is zero, so the $Re$ coefficient in front of this term in the scaled PDEs is not important and can be set to unity. In that case, setting $\\rho=\\mu=1$ in the original Navier - Stokes equations resembles the scaled model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific engineering problem one wants to simulate a specific fluid and set corresponding parameters. A general solver is therefore most naturally implemented with dimensions and the original physical parameters. However, scaling may greatly simplify numerical simulations. First of all, it shows that all fluids behave in the same way: it does not matter whether we have oil, gas, or water flowing between two plates, and it does not matter how fast the flow is (up to some criticial value of the Reynolds number where the flow becomes unstable and transitions to a complicated turbulent flow of totally different nature). This means that one simulation is enough to cover all types of channel flow! In other applications, scaling shows that it might be necessary to set just the fraction of some parameters (dimensionless numbers) rather than the parameters themselves. This simplifies exploring the input parameter space which is often the purpose of simulation. Frequently, the scaled problem is run by setting some of the input parameters with dimension to fixed values (often unity).\n",

    "\n",
    "It is well-known that certain finite element spaces are not stable for the Navier - Stokes equations, or even for the simpler Stokes equations. The prime example of an unstable pair of finite element spaces is to use first degree continuous piecewise polynomials for both the velocity and the pressure. Using an unstable pair of spaces typically results in a solution with *spurious* (unwanted, non-physical) oscillations in the pressure solution. The simple remedy is to use continuous piecewise quadratic elements for the velocity and continuous piecewise linear elements for the pressure. Together, these elements form the so-called *Taylor-Hood* element. Spurious oscillations may occur also for splitting methods if an unstable element pair is used.     \n",

    "#### Test problem 2: Flow past a cylinder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn our attention to a more challenging problem: flow past a circular cylinder. The geometry and parameters are taken from problem DFG 2D-2 in the [FEATFLOW/1995-DFG benchmark suite](http://www.featflow.de/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/flow/dfg_benchmark2_re100.html) and is illustrated in Figure [Geometry for the flow past a cylinder test problem](#cylinder_geometry). Notice the slightly perturbed and unsymmetric geometry. The kinematic viscosity is given by $\\nu=0.001=\\mu/\\rho$ and the inflow velocity profile is specified as\n",

    "u(x,y,t)&=\\big(1.5\\cdot \\frac{4y(0.41−y)}{0.41^2},0\\big),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "which has a maximum magnitude of $1.5$ at $y=0.41/2$. We do not use any scaling for this problem since all exact parameters are known.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### FEniCS implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far all our domains have been simple shapes such as a unit square or a rectangular box. A number of such simple meshes may be created using the built-in mesh classes in FEniCS (```UnitIntervalMesh```, ```UnitSquareMesh```, ```UnitCubeMesh```, ```IntervalMesh```, ```RectangleMesh```, ```BoxMesh```). FEniCS supports the creation of more complex meshes via a technique called constructive solid geometry (CSG), which lets us define geometries in terms of simple shapes (primitives) and set operations: union, intersection, and set difference. The set operations are encoded in FEniCS using the operators ```+``` (union), ```*``` (intersection), and ```-``` (set difference). To access the CSG functionality in FEniCS, one must import the FEniCS module ```mshr``` which provides the extended meshing functionality of FEniCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometry for the cylinder flow test problem can be defined easily by first defining the rectangular channel and then subtracting the circle:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "channel = Rectangle(Point(0, 0), Point(2.2, 0.41))\n",
    "cylinder = Circle(Point(0.2, 0.2), 0.05)\n",
    "domain = channel - cylinder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We may then create the mesh by calling the function ```generate_mesh```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mesh = generate_mesh(domain, 64)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the argument ```64``` indicates that we want to resolve the geometry with 64 cells across its diameter (the channel length).\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the cylinder test problem, we only need to make a few minor changes to the code we wrote for the channel flow test case. Besides defining the new mesh, the only change we need to make is to modify the boundary conditions and the time step size. The boundaries are specified as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "inflow   = 'near(x[0], 0)'\n",
    "outflow  = 'near(x[0], 2.2)'\n",
    "walls    = 'near(x[1], 0) || near(x[1], 0.41)'\n",
    "cylinder = 'on_boundary && x[0]>0.1 && x[0]<0.3 && x[1]>0.1 && x[1]<0.3'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line may seem cryptic before you catch the idea: we want to pick out all boundary points (```on_boundary```) that also lie within the 2D domain $[0.1,0.3]\\times[0.1,0.3]$, see [Figure Geometry for the flow past a cylinder test problem](#cylinder_geometry). Notice the slightly perturbed and unsymmetric geometry. The only possible points are then the points on the circular boundary!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these essential changes, we will make a number of small changes to improve our solver. First, since we need to choose a relatively small time step to compute the solution (a time step that is too large will make the solution blow up) we add a progress bar so that we can follow the progress of our computation. This can be done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "progress = Progress('Time-stepping')\n",
    "set_log_level(PROGRESS)\n",

    "# Time-stepping\n",

    "    # Place computation here\n",

    "<markdown>    \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Log levels and printing in FEniCS**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice the call to ```set_log_level(PROGRESS)``` which is essential to make FEniCS actually display the progress bar. FEniCS is actually quite informative about what is going on during a computation but the amount of information printed to screen depends on the current log level. Only messages with a priority higher than or equal to the current log level will be displayed. The predefined log levels in FEniCS are ```DBG```, ```TRACE```, ```PROGRESS```, ```INFO```, ```WARNING```, ```ERROR```, and ```CRITICAL```. By default, the log level is set to ```INFO``` which means that messages at level ```DBG```, ```TRACE```, and ```PROGRESS``` will not be printed. Users may print messages using the FEniCS functions ```info```, ```warning```, and ```error``` which will print messages at the obvious log level (and in the case of ```error``` also throw an exception and exit). One may also use the call ```log(level, message)``` to print a message at a specific log level.\n",
    "</markdown>\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the system(s) of linear equations are significantly larger than for the simple channel flow test problem, we choose to use an iterative method instead of the default direct (sparse) solver used by FEniCS when calling ```solve```. Efficient solution of linear systems arising from the discretization of PDEs requires the choice of both a good iterative (Krylov subspace) method and a good preconditioner. For this problem, we will simply use the biconjugate gradient stabilized method (BiCGSTAB) and the conjugate gradient method. This can be done by adding the keywords ```bicgstab``` or ```cg``` in the call to ```solve```. We also specify suitable preconditioners to speed up the computations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "solve(A1, u1.vector(), b1, 'bicgstab', 'hypre_amg')\n",
    "solve(A2, p1.vector(), b2, 'bicgstab', 'hypre_amg')\n",
    "solve(A3, u1.vector(), b3, 'cg', 'sor')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the present example, we will choose to save the solution to XDMF format. This file format works similarly to the ```.pvd``` files we have seen earlier but has several advantages. First, the storage is much more efficient, both in terms of speed and file sizes. Second, ```.xdmf``` files work in parallell, both for writing and reading (postprocessing). Much like ```.pvd``` files, the actual data will not be stored in the ```.xdmf``` file itself, but will instead be stored in a (single) separate data file with the suffix ```.hdf5``` which is an advanced file format designed for high-performance computing. We create the XDMF files as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xdmffile_u = XDMFFile('navier_stokes_cylinder/velocity.xdmf')\n",
    "xdmffile_p = XDMFFile('navier_stokes_cylinder/pressure.xdmf')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each time step, we may then store the velocity and pressure by\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xdmffile_u.write(u, t)\n",
    "xdmffile_p.write(p, t)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We also store the solution using a FEniCS ```TimeSeries```. This allows us to store the solution not for visualization, but for later reuse in a computation as we will see in the next section. Using a ```TimeSeries``` it is easy and efficient to read in solutions from certain points in time during a simulation. The ```TimeSeries``` class also uses the HDF5 file format for efficient storage and access to data.\n",
